## Supermarket Pricing
 
The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.
 
Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. <br /> 
For example:<br />
• three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?) <br />
• $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?) <br />
• buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?) <br />
 
The exercise is to experiment with a model that is flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes.
